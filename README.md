# Smart Order Block Indicator

This is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to analyze multiple timeframes and detect market reversals based on order block values and a specified threshold.

## Functionality

The Smart Order Block Indicator performs the following tasks:

1. **Initialization**: It sets up the indicator buffers and label.

2. **Iteration**: It iterates through each timeframe and performs the analysis.

   - **Order Block Calculation**: It calculates the order block value by summing the closing prices of the specified period and dividing it by the period length.

   - **Reversal Detection**: It compares the current price with the previous price and checks if the price difference exceeds the specified threshold multiplied by the order block value. If a reversal is detected, it executes a buy or sell order accordingly.

## Indicator Parameters

The following parameters can be adjusted in the code:

- `timeframeCount`: Number of timeframes to analyze.
